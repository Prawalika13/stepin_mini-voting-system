## Requirements
## Introduction
 Voting plays a major role during elections in a democratic country like India, where every citizen above the age of 18 has the right to vote. Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) is a simple device to count votes during elections. Electronic Voting Machines are used to avoid security related problems. hence, many biometric based  authentications have been introduced. Face detection and recognition technique are one of the most important biometrics. Face detection is the process of detecting a face in an image or a video. Face recognition takes the image detected and tries to identify to whom the face belongs.
Features:
 The feature used in this project as listed below
•	Add voter's information:
	Voter's name
	Voter's date of birth
	Voter's phone number
	Status of Voting
•	View voting status - Shows whether the voter has casted the vote or not
•	Results - Displays the updated realtime count of the votes for each party

## Objective:
To develop a secure voting system which utilizes the method of  Face recognition to make the voting process secure and fully automatic.

## Strength:
•	It reduces the chance of false voting.
•	It also reduces the chance of duplicate data entry.
•	Electronic Voting process requires less manual work.
•	It helps to achieve better accuracy and save the time.
•	Since the electronic voting process will not have any human intervention, it helps to increase people’s trust in the voting management.

## Weakness:
•	The Voting System should have good internet connection or system.
•	Sometimes it might be difficult for the system for recognize the face of identical folks such as twins.
•	For the Camera to capture image of voter’s face, proper lighting should be ensure.

## Threats:
System threats refers to 
•	Misuse of system services and network connections to put user in trouble.
•	System threats can be used to launch program threats on a complete network called as program attack. 
•	System threats creates such an environment that operating system resources/ user files are misused.
 
## Oppurtunities:
•	Voting system can be made more secured by adding more number of verification steps.
•	It can install a process to enable people with disabilities to vote by themselves, easily and in secrecy.
•	Over time it reduces the overall cost to operate and manage the election process.

## 4 W's and 1 H
 
## Who
Anyone who is Voting for the frist time can vote easily as the system display instruction for each step. 

## What
This project is concerned about solving the Data manipulation issues when voting is conducted manually.
## When
Whenever there is an attempt of false voting this project helps to detect the false voting.
## Why
As this project uses simple instructions and steps it makes the voting process easier.
## How
Implemented using functionalities of C.
Basic requirements that are very essential are:
•	gcc compiler with a good system.
•	Any of the two linux/windows.

## HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
| ID | DESCRIPTION | STATUS(IMPLEMENTED/FAILURE) |
| :--: | :---: | :----: |
| HR01 | Voting System which utilizes the method of  Face recognition to make the voting process secure and fully automatic. | IMPLEMENTED |
| HR02 | The voting process can be made more secure by adding additional verification methods like fingerprint recognition, iris scanner etc. | FUTURE |
| HR03 | The database used in this project is hosted by Firebase, a private server can be created to store all the sensitivity information such as voter personal details and election results to increase the security of the database. | FUTURE |
